<h2>Hi, I'm Cassandra.</h2>
<p>I'm a Website Designer and Developer from Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love playing and creating video games. I am fairly active in the indie developer scene in Vancouver and I often participate in game jams. My favourite games are Hyper Light Drifter, Destiny 2 and Elden Ring. Check out my <a href="https://cassandracarlos.itch.io/">itch.io page</a> for a full list of the games I've worked on.</p>
