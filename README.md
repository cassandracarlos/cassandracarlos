<h2>Hi! I'm Cassandra.</h2>

<p>I'm a Website Developer from Vancouver, Canada. My schtick includes making custom-tailored websites for local businesses and making snazzy WordPress themes for everyone else.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love playing and creating video games, participating in the occasional game jam. Check out my <a href="https://cassandracarlos.itch.io/">itch.io page</a> for a full list of the games I've worked on.</p>
